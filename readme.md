Lightning Bitcoin (LBTC) is a fully decentralized Internet-of-value protocol for global payments. Lightning Bitcoin is forked from [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoin.org/). Lightning Bitcoin full node replaces PoW consensus of Bitcoin with DPoS, it means LBTC fully meets bitcoin standard expect consensus algorithm.

LBTCnodes is currently being developed to estimate the size of the LBTC network by finding all the reachable nodes in the network. The current methodology involves sending [getaddr](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_specification#getaddr) messages recursively to find all the reachable nodes in the network, starting from a set of seed nodes.
